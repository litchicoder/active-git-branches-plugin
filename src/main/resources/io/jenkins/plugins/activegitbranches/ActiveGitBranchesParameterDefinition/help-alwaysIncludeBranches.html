    <p>
        A regular expression pattern for branches that should <b>always be included</b> in the list, 
        regardless of the commit date or the "Max Branch Count" limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        These branches will still be subject to the "Branch Filter" if configured, or you can choose to make them bypass it based on implementation preferences (Current design: They bypass the Top N limit, but must still be valid branches).
    </p>
    <p>
        Useful for keeping main branches like <code>master</code>, <code>main</code>, or <code>develop</code> always visible.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <code>^(main|master|develop)$</code></p>
